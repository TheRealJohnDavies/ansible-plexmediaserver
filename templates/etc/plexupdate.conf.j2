# CHECKUPDATE: If you didn't install using git clone or by running the instal-
# ler, you can use this option to notify you when there are updates to plexup-
# date. If you used git or the installer, see AUTOUPDATE instead.
#CHECKUPDATE=yes

# PLEXSERVER: If set, and combined with AUTOINSTALL, the script will auto-
# matically check if the server is in use and defer the update. Great for 
# crontab users. PLEXSERVER should be set to the IP/DNS of your Plex Media
# Server, which typically is 127.0.0.1
#PLEXSERVER=127.0.0.1

# PLEXPORT: Sets the port to use along with PLEXSERVER
#PLEXPORT=32400

# AUTOUPDATE: Makes plexupdate.sh automatically update itself using git. This
# only works if you installed using git clone or by using the installer.
#AUTOUPDATE=yes
AUTOUPDATE={{ plexupdate_AUTOUPDATE }}

# AUTOINSTALL: Automatically installs the newly downloaded version. Currently
# works for Debian based systems as well as rpm based distros. Requires root
# permissions.
#AUTOINSTALL=yes
AUTOINSTALL={{ plexupdate_AUTOINSTALL }}

# AUTODELETE: Delete the downloaded package after installation is complete to
# conserve disk space.
#AUTODELETE=yes
AUTODELETE={{ plexupdate_AUTODELETE }}

# PUBLIC: The default behavior of plexupdate.sh is to download the PlexPass
# edition of Plex Media Server. Setting this option to yes will make it down-
# load the public version instead.
#PUBLIC=no
PUBLIC={{ plexupdate_PUBLIC }}

# FORCE: Normally plexupdate.sh will avoid downloading a file it already has
# or if it's the same as the installed version. Using this option will force
# it to download again UNLESS the file already downloaded has the correct
# checksum. If you have AUTOINSTALL set, plexupdate.sh will then reinstall it.
#FORCE=no

# PRINT_URL: Authenticate, fetch the download URL, print it, and then exit.
#PRINT_URL=no

# DISTRO_INSTALL: The command used to install packages, only change if you need
# special options. Natively supports Debian and Redhat, so you don't need to
# set this for these systems. NOTE! If you define this, you MUST define DISTRO
# and BUILD.
#DISTRO_INSTALL=

# DISTRO and BUILD Override which version to download, use -l option to see
# what you can select.
#DISTRO=
#BUILD=

# TOKEN: If you want to install Plex Pass releases, plexupdate will try to get
# your account token directly from your Plex Media Server. If you want to use
# a different token to authenticate, you can enter it here instead. Please
# read Authenticating with Plex Pass on the wiki for more details.
#TOKEN=

# NOTIFY: Should cron send you an email if an update is available/installed?
#NOTIFY=yes
